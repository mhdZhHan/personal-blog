Hey there, awesome developers! 👋 Today, we're diving into the world of MERN stack deployment. Whether you're a coding newbie or a seasoned pro, this guide will walk you through setting up your project for both development and production. Let's get started! 

## 1. 🏗️ Project Setup

Our MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack project has two main parts:

- 📂 `server`: This is where our backend lives.
- 📂 `client`: Home to our React frontend.

Here's the correct project structure:

```bash
my-mern-app/
├── server/
│   └── server.js
├── client/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── vite.config.js
├── package.json
└── .env
```

Note that we have a `package.json` file in the root of the project and another one in the `client` directory. This setup allows us to manage dependencies and scripts for both the server and client from the project root.

## 2. 🛠️ Development Environment

In development, we run our backend and frontend separately. This setup allows for hot reloading and easier debugging.

### Backend (Express Server)

In `server/server.js`:

```js title="server/server.js"
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

app.get('/api/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from the server! 👋' });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT} 🚀`));
```

### Frontend (React with Vite)

In `client/vite.config.js`:

```javascript title="client/vite.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': 'http://localhost:5000',
    },
  },
});
```

This config sets up a proxy, so when your React app makes a request to `/api`, it's forwarded to your Express server. It's like having a tiny mailman for your development setup! 📮

### Root package.json

In the root `package.json`, add these scripts:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon server/server.js",
    "start": "node server/server.js",
    "build": "npm install && npm install --prefix client && npm run build --prefix client"
  }
}
```

These scripts allow you to:
- Run the server in development mode with hot reloading (`npm run dev`)
- Start the server in production mode (`npm start`)
- Build the entire project, including installing dependencies and building the client (`npm run build`)

## 3. 🌐 Production Environment

Here's where the magic happens! In production, we serve everything from a single domain. No need for separate deployments for API and client. It's like a one-stop-shop for your app! 🏪

Update your `server/server.js`:

```javascript title="server/server.js"
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

app.use(express.json());

app.get('/api/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from the server! 👋' });
});

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../client/dist')));
  app.get('*', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, '../client', 'dist', 'index.html'));
  });
}

app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT} 🚀`));
```

This setup serves your React app and handles all routes in production. It's like a smart butler for your app! 🧐🍽️

## 4. 🪄 The Magical Deploy Script

Before we dive into the deploy script, you need to create it in your project. You have two options:

1. Create a new file named `deploy.sh` in the root of your project and copy the script content into it.

2. Or, you can download the script directly using curl:

```bash
curl -o deploy.sh https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mhdZhHan/5a18d763a92b8ad8eb08f9a74cc7625a/raw/be7448bbbfd0992f82673386a868d25b4cecbbb9/deploy.sh
```

After downloading or creating the file, make sure to make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
```

Now, let's look at our deploy script. It's like a Swiss Army knife for your deployment! 🇨🇭🔪

```bash title="deploy.sh"
#!/bin/bash

# 🎭 Ask for the star of our show
echo "What's your domain name, superstar? (e.g., example.com):"
read DOMAIN_NAME

# 🔧 Update and install our toolkit
echo "Time to upgrade our toolbox! 🧰"
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx curl software-properties-common

# 🌱 Plant the Node.js seed
echo "Planting the Node.js tree! 🌳"
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
sudo npm install pm2 -g

# 🔑 Secret keeper (.env file handler)
setup_env() {
    echo "Let's set up our secret codes! 🕵️‍♀️"
    local env_file=".env"
    local default_vars=("MONGODB_URL" "JWT_SECRET" "NODE_ENV" "PORT")
    
    if [ -f "$env_file" ]; then
        echo "Existing .env file found. Updating values..."
        source "$env_file"
    else
        echo "Creating new .env file..."
    fi
    
    for var in "${default_vars[@]}"; do
        read -p "Enter $var (current: ${!var}): " new_value
        if [ ! -z "$new_value" ]; then
            eval "$var='$new_value'"
        fi
    done
    
    # Prompt for additional variables
    while true; do
        read -p "Add another environment variable? (y/n): " add_more
        if [[ $add_more != "y" ]]; then
            break
        fi
        read -p "Enter variable name: " var_name
        read -p "Enter variable value: " var_value
        eval "$var_name='$var_value'"
    done
    
    # Write to .env file
    > "$env_file"
    for var in $(compgen -v); do
        if [[ ! "$var" =~ ^(BASH|HOSTNAME|HOME|PWD|SHELL|USER|_).*$ ]]; then
            echo "$var=\"${!var}\"" >> "$env_file"
        fi
    done
    
    echo ".env file updated successfully. 🎉"
}

# Call the setup_env function
setup_env

# 🏗️ Building our masterpiece
echo "Time to build our Lego set! 🧱"
npm install
npm run build

# 🚦 Traffic director (Nginx setup)
setup_nginx() {
    echo "Setting up our traffic signs for $DOMAIN_NAME 🚦"
    local config_path="/etc/nginx/sites-available/$DOMAIN_NAME"
    
    if [ -f "$config_path" ]; then
        echo "Nginx configuration for $DOMAIN_NAME already exists. Updating..."
        sudo rm "$config_path"
    fi
    
    sudo tee "$config_path" > /dev/null <<EOF
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name $DOMAIN_NAME;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:$PORT;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade \$http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host \$host;
        proxy_cache_bypass \$http_upgrade;
    }
}
EOF
    
    sudo ln -sf "$config_path" "/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/"
    sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
    
    echo "Nginx configured for $DOMAIN_NAME 🚦"
}

# Call the setup_nginx function
setup_nginx

# 🔒 Security guard (SSL setup)
echo "Calling our security team! 🛡️"
sudo certbot --nginx -d "$DOMAIN_NAME"

# Start the app with PM2
echo "Launching our rocket! 🚀"
pm2 start npm --name "$DOMAIN_NAME" -- start

# 🧱 Firewall (the bouncer at our app's nightclub)
echo "Setting up the velvet rope 🔥🧱"
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw --force enable

echo "🎉 Woohoo! Your app is now live at https://$DOMAIN_NAME 🎉"
```

This script does it all:
- Sets up your environment variables 🔐
- Installs necessary software 🧰
- Builds your app 🏗️
- Configures Nginx as a reverse proxy 🚦
- Sets up SSL for secure connections 🔒
- Configures the firewall 🧱

## 5. 🧩 Putting It All Together

Here's how to use this setup:

1. In development:
   - Run your Express server: `npm run dev` (from the project root)
   - Run your React app: `cd client && npm run dev`
   - Your app is now running on two ports, but the proxy makes it feel like one!

2. For production:
   - Push your code to your server
   - Run the deploy script: `./deploy.sh`
   - Watch as your app magically comes to life on a single domain! ✨

And there you have it! You've just learned how to set up and deploy a MERN stack application like a pro. 🏆

Remember, deployment might seem tricky at first, but with practice, you'll be deploying apps in your sleep (though we don't recommend coding while sleeping 😴).

Happy coding, and may your servers always be up and your bugs be few! 🚀🐞
