Whether you're a coding pro or just getting started, this setup will make your terminal not only look cool but also super efficient. Let's dive in and transform your terminal experience!

### Installation Guide

Ready to make your terminal awesome? Weâ€™re going to install Zsh and then add Oh My Zsh to make it colorful, smart, and fun to use. Let's get started!

### 1. Install Zsh

First, we need to install Zsh. Donâ€™t worry, itâ€™s easy!

<InPageNav
    routes={["macOS", "Ubuntu/Debian", "Fedora", "Arch"]}
>
```bash
# Install Homebrew (if you havenâ€™t already)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
# Update Zsh to the latest version
brew install zsh
```
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zsh
```

```bash
sudo dnf install zsh
```

```bash
sudo pacman -S zsh
```
</InPageNav>

### 2. Set Zsh as Your Default Shell

Now that Zsh is installed, letâ€™s make it your default shell. This way, youâ€™ll start using it every time you open a terminal:

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

### 3. Install Oh My Zsh

Finally, weâ€™ll install (Oh My Zsh)[https://ohmyz.sh/], which will make your terminal look amazing and give you tons of cool features:

<InPageNav
    routes={["Install oh-my-zsh via curl", "Install oh-my-zsh via wget"]}
>
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

```bash
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```
</InPageNav>

### 4. Install PowerLevel10k

Now that youâ€™ve got Oh My Zsh set up, itâ€™s time to make your terminal look even cooler with (PowerLevel10k)[https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k], a theme that adds some serious style and functionality.

To install PowerLevel10k, just run the following command:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k
```

### 5. Install the Meslo Nerd Font

Before activating `PowerLevel10k`, you'll need to install the Meslo Nerd Font. This font ensures that all the special icons and symbols in PowerLevel10k display correctly. Here's how to install it on different operating systems:

<InPageNav
    routes={["macOS", "Ubuntu/Debian & Fedora", "Arch"]}
>
```bash
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
```

```bash
wget https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Regular.ttf
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts
mv 'MesloLGS NF Regular.ttf' ~/.local/share/fonts/
fc-cache -f -v
```

```bash
yay -S ttf-meslo-nerd-font-powerlevel10k
```
</InPageNav>

Once the font is installed, go to your terminal's settings and change the font to `MesloLGS NF`.


### 6. Activate PowerLevel10k

After installing, letâ€™s activate the theme:

1. **Open your** `.zshrc` file in your favorite text editor:

```zsh
nano ~/.zshrc
```

2. **Find the line** that says `ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"` and replace `"robbyrussell"` with `"powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"`. It should look like this:

```zsh
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
```

3. **Save the file** and exit the editor (`CTRL + O` to save, then `CTRL + X` to exit).

4. Apply the changes by restarting your terminal or running:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 7. Configure PowerLevel10k
When you restart your terminal after activating PowerLevel10k, the configuration wizard should start automatically. This wizard will guide you through customizing the appearance and features of your terminal prompt, allowing you to choose different styles, icons, and layouts.

If the configuration wizard doesn't start automatically, don't worry! You can manually start it by running the following command:

```zsh
p10k configure
```

This command will launch the configuration wizard, letting you set up or tweak your PowerLevel10k theme as you like.

> Remember, you can run `p10k configure` anytime if you want to reconfigure your setup later.


### 8. Setting Up Plugins (Optional but Highly Recommended)

To make your terminal even more powerful, you can install some useful plugins. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

**1. Autosuggestions Plugin**
This plugin suggests commands as you type, based on your history and completions.
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

**2. Syntax Highlighting Plugins**
These plugins highlight command syntax in your terminal:

- ***zsh-syntax-highlighting:***
  ```zsh
  git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
  ```

- ***zsh-fast-syntax-highlighting:***
  ```zsh
  git clone https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/fast-syntax-highlighting
  ```

**3. Autocomplete Plugin**

This plugin improves tab completion, making it more efficient.

```zsh
git clone --depth 1 -- https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autocomplete
```

**4. Enabling the Plugins**
Now that youâ€™ve installed the plugins, you need to enable them:

- Open your `.zshrc` file:
- Find the line that says plugins=(git).
- Replace that line with:
```zsh title=".zshrc"
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting fast-syntax-highlighting zsh-autocomplete)
```

### Note on zsh-autosuggestions Plugin
Some users experience an issue with ghost text appearing when they paste something into the terminal and then move to the end of the command using the arrow keys. This happens because the autosuggestions plugin might conflict with the pasted text.

To fix this issue, add the following line to your `.zshrc` file:

```zsh title=".zshrc"
ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_CLEAR_WIDGETS+=(bracketed-paste)
```

Make sure to place this line after the following in your `.zshrc` file:

![help image](/images/blogs/oh-my-zsh.png)
 
This will help prevent any conflicts with the `zsh-autosuggestions` plugin when pasting commands into your terminal.

ðŸŽ‰ Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ve now transformed your terminal into a powerful, colorful, and super supportive workspace with Oh My Zsh and PowerLevel10k. Your terminal should be looking sharp and performing like a champ. Donâ€™t forget to explore more plugins to keep enhancing your setup.

Happy coding, and see you next time! ðŸ‘‹
