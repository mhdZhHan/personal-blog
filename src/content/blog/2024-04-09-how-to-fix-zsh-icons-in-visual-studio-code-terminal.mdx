Hey folks! So, I've been tinkering around with my Manjaro system running KDE Plasma, and I noticed something strange when I fired up Visual Studio Code for coding. You see, Manjaro comes with Zsh as the default terminal, and I'm a big fan of its features. But when I started using Zsh in Visual Studio Code, I ran into a problem â€“ the cool icons that usually appear in the terminal were missing! It turns out, this isn't just a problem on my Manjaro setup; it's something that can happen on other systems too. But don't worry, I've done some sleuthing and found a fix. Let me show you how to get those Zsh icons back in Visual Studio Code.

## Solution

I'm using Manjaro with (KDE) and this solution worked for me:

1. **Install the Meslo Nerd Font:**

- For Manjaro and Arch based distro's:
```bash title="Konsole"
sudo pacman -S ttf-meslo-nerd-font-powerlevel10k
```
- For Ubuntu and Debian based distro's:
```bash title="Konsole"
sudo apt-get install fonts-meslo
```

> **For Other Linux Distributions:**
> The installation process may vary slightly depending on your Linux distribution. However, you can typically install the Meslo Nerd Font using your package manager. Simply search for "fonts-meslo" or "ttf-meslo-nerd-font-powerlevel10k" and install it. Once installed, follow the same steps mentioned above to configure the font settings in Visual Studio Code.

2. **Configure Vscode Font Settings:**
   To ensure that Visual Studio Code displays the Zsh icons correctly, follow these steps:

    - Open Visual Studio Code.
    - Navigate to `Terminal > Integrated: Font Family`.
    - Set the font family to "MesloLGS NF".

3. **Alternatively, Change Font Settings Directly in settings.json:**
   You can also change it directly in the `settings.json` file located in the `.config/Code/User` directory. Look for the property `terminal.integrated.fontFamily`.

```json title="settings.json"
"terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "MesloLGS NF"
```

4. **Restart Visual Studio Code:**
   After making the font changes, restart Visual Studio Code.

5. **Enjoy Your Enhanced Terminal Experience:**
   Your terminal font should now correctly display the Zsh icons!

Moreover, this method will also work for macOS users, although the font installation process might differ slightly.

Happy vscoding! ðŸš€
