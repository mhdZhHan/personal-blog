Hey there, web developers! Today, we're diving into integrating Firebase Authentication into your Astro project using the latest feature: Astro Actions. Whether you're building a new app or adding authentication to an existing project, this guide will walk you through the process of setting up Firebase Auth and leveraging Astro Actions to handle server-side logic.

## What Are Astro Actions?

Astro Actions are an experimental feature that allow you to handle server-side logic directly within your Astro components. This feature is perfect for managing authentication flows, interacting with APIs, and handling other server-side tasks without needing a separate backend.

With Astro Actions, you can define and call backend functions with full type-safety from your client code. This makes it easy to work with form submissions, manage user data, and more. The feature is designed to simplify the process of integrating complex backend functionalities into your Astro project.

### Setting Up Astro Actions

To upgrade an existing project, use the automated `@astrojs/upgrade` CLI tool. Alternatively, upgrade manually by running the upgrade command for your package manager:

```bash
# Recommended:
npx @astrojs/upgrade

# Manual:
npm install astro@latest
pnpm upgrade astro --latest
yarn upgrade astro --latest
```

To use this feature, add a server build output and enable the experimental.actions option in your Astro config:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"

export default defineConfig({
  output: "hybrid", // or 'server'
  experimental: {
    actions: true,
  },
})
```

## Integrating Firebase Authenticationc

Now that Astro Actions are set up, letâ€™s integrate Firebase Authentication into your Astro project. Follow these steps to get everything configured.

**Install Firebase:** Add Firebase to your project using your package manager:

<InPageNav
    routes={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}
>
```bash
npm install firebase
```
```bash
yarn add firebase
```
```bash
pnpm add firebase
```
</InPageNav>

**Initialize Firebase:** Configure Firebase in your project. Create a file like `/src/firebase/config.ts`:

```ts
import { initializeApp, getApps, getApp } from "firebase/app"
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth"

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: import.meta.env.API_KEY,
  authDomain: import.meta.env.AUTH_DOMAIN,
  projectId: import.meta.env.PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: import.meta.env.STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: import.meta.env.MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: import.meta.env.APP_ID,
  measurementId: import.meta.env.MEASUREMENT_ID,
}

const app = !getApps().length ? initializeApp(firebaseConfig) : getApp()

export const auth = getAuth(app)
```
