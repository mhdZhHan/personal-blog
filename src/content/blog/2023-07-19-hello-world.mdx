## Fun with Markdown

Let's have some fun with Markdown! Here are some additional Markdown elements to explore:

### Emojis

Markdown supports emojis! ðŸ˜„ðŸš€

### Tables

| Language   | Code Sample                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Python     | `print("Hello, World!")`        |
| JavaScript | `console.log("Hello, World!");` |

### Task Lists

-   [x] Learn Markdown

### Superscript and Subscript

-   E=mc<sup>2</sup>
-   H<sub>2</sub>O

## Fun with Code

Now, let's have some fun with code! Here's a classic "Hello, World!" example in Python and JavaScript:

### Python

```python title="main.py"
print("Hello, World!")
```

### JavaScript

```js title="hello.js" showLineNumbers{5}
console.log("hewwo") // [!code --]
console.log("hello") // [!code ++]
console.log("goodbye")
```

```js title="App.js" /age/#v /name/#v /setAge/#s /setName/#s /50/#i /"Taylor"/#i
const [age, setAge] = useState(50)
const [name, setName] = useState("Taylor")
```

### Lets code a for loop in C++

In this tutorial, we will loop through a for loop and print out the values of i

```cpp title="loop.cpp"
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  std::cout << i << std::endl;
}
```

Aren't they hilarious? ðŸ˜„
