After a successful Arch Linux installation and the first reboot, it's time to start setting things up! Here's how I began transforming my fresh Arch installation into a functional and personalized environment.

## First Things First: Update Your System
Right after booting into my new Arch Linux system, I made sure everything was up to date. It's a simple yet crucial step:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syyu
```
This command updates the package database and upgrades all installed packages to the latest version.

## Essential Packages: Git and Development Tools
Next, I needed some essential tools to get started. I installed `git` for version control and `base-devel`, which includes essential development tools:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel
```

With `git` installed, I configured my name and email for version control:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Mohammed"
git config --global user.email "hello@example.com"
```

## Installing Essential Utilities

To enhance the functionality of my system and prepare it for daily use, I installed some essential utilities. These tools cover power management, file viewing, and compatibility with various file systems. Here's the command to install them:

```bash
sudo pacman -S power-profiles-daemon ntfs-3g exfatprogs linux-headers
```

### What Do These Packages Do?

- **Power Profiles Daemon**: A utility to manage power profiles for better energy efficiency or performance.
- **NTFS-3G**: A driver for full read and write support for NTFS file systems, commonly used in Windows.
- **exfatprogs**: Utilities for handling exFAT file systems, often used in USB drives and SD cards.
- **Linux Headers**: Required for building kernel modules, such as drivers for specific hardware.

> With these tools, my system is equipped to handle a wide range of tasks, from multimedia playback to file compatibility and power optimization.

## Installing Yay: The AUR Helper
To easily manage and install AUR (Arch User Repository) packages, I decided to install `yay`, a handy AUR helper. But before jumping into that, I created a special directory for all my development tools—my secret stash, if you will.

First, I set up a `"Developer"` directory. Why? Well, it's a great habit to keep all your personal building tools and projects organized. I also use this directory to store other development environments like Golang, Flutter, and more. Think of it as your project's headquarters—keeping everything tidy and in one place makes life so much easier.


Here’s how I did it:
```bash
mkdir Developer
cd Developer
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

And just like that, yay was installed. I checked the installation with:
```bash
yay --version
```
For more about yay, check out its [GitHub page](https://github.com/Jguer/yay).

## Enabling Bluetooth: The Missing Link
Sometimes, after installing Arch Linux, you might notice that the Bluetooth option is mysteriously missing. But don't worry—it's a quick fix!

Just run these commands to enable and start Bluetooth:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
```

And that’s it, baby, that’s it! 😄

> **Note**: If this doesn't work, there might be a problem with your Bluetooth configuration or you may not have installed the driver. Google it and find a solution, brother. You've got this!

## Setting Up ICC Profiles: Fixing Screen Gamma Issues

Sometimes, after installing Arch Linux—or even other Linux distributions—you might notice that your screen's gamma is off, causing colors to look incorrect or washed out. This isn’t necessarily an Arch Linux-specific problem; it can happen on other distros as well. It could be due to driver issues or BIOS settings, but a common solution is to use ICC profiles to correct the gamma.

I faced this issue on my system and, after some research, discovered that ICC profiles could help. I don’t know much more about the technical details, but applying an ICC profile improved the color accuracy on my screen.

Here’s what I did:

1. **Download ICC Profiles**: I found a set of ICC profiles that work well for my setup. You can download them from my GitHub repository: [ICC Profiles](https://github.com/mhdZhHan/dotfiles/tree/main/gamma-icc).

2. **Apply the ICC Profile**: Follow the instructions for your desktop environment to apply the ICC profile. Usually, this involves using a color management tool to load and set the profile.

And that’s it! The colors on my screen look great now, and I’m much happier with the display quality.

> **Note**: If you’re experiencing similar issues, give ICC profiles a try. They can often resolve color and gamma problems. If you don't have such issues, you can skip this section.

Now, let’s move on to customizing our Plasma desktop to make it truly ours!

## Customizing My Plasma Desktop: Making It Truly Mine

Now that we've got the basics down, let's make our Arch Linux setup uniquely ours with some cool Plasma customizations. Here’s how I turned my desktop into a sleek workspace:

### 1. Customizing the Plasma Panels

My desktop looks like: 

![Buraq Home](/images/blogs/buraq-home.jpg "Buraq home")

**1. Install Plasma Widgets:**

- [KMenu Wrap](https://store.kde.org/p/2154894)
- [Window Title Applet 6 Wrap](https://www.pling.com/p/2129423/)
- [Simple Separator for Plasma 6](https://www.pling.com/p/2137418/)
- [CatWalk](https://www.pling.com/p/2137844/)
- [Compact Pager](https://www.pling.com/p/2112443/)

**2. Add the Applet Configuration File**

Download my applet configuration file from [My GitHub - appletarc](https://github.com/mhdZhHan/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc) and place it inside your `.config` directory.

This file configures the panels to look just like mine. Cool, right?

### 2. Removing Title Bars with KWin Rules

I’m not a fan of title bars cluttering my view, so I removed them using KWin rules. Here’s how you can do it too:

**1. Download My KWin Rules:**
Get the KWin rules file from my GitHub: [buraq-kwin-rules.kwinrule](https://github.com/mhdZhHan/dotfiles/blob/main/buraq-kwin-rules.kwinrule)

**2. Add the KWin Rule:**
Go to `Settings > Window Management > Window Rules`.
Click `Import` and select the downloaded `.kwinrule` file.

### 3. Icon Pack Customization

To give my desktop a cohesive and stylish look, I’m using the [**GruvBox Icon Theme**](https://store.kde.org/p/1327720). It adds a unique touch to the icons on my system.

Here’s how my desktop looks with this icon pack:
