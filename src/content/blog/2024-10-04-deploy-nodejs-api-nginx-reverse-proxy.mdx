Hey there, web architects! 👋 Ready to build your own internet skyscraper? Let's deploy a Node.js API and set up Nginx as a reverse proxy. It's like creating your own web traffic control tower! 🏢

## Part 1: Building Our Express Skyscraper 🏗️

### Step 1: Get Your Building Materials (Install Node.js and npm) 🧱

First, let's get our tools ready. Open your terminal and type:

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

### Step 2: Create Your Construction Site 🚧

Let's make a spot for our new building:

```bash
mkdir express-app
cd express-app
npm init -y
```

### Step 3: Gather More Supplies (Install Dependencies) 🛠️

Time to get some special building blocks:

```bash
npm install express nodemon
```

### Step 4: Draw Up the Blueprints (Update package.json) 📝

Open your `package.json` and make it look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "express-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon index.js"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.19.2",
    "nodemon": "^3.1.4"
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Build Your Express Elevator (Create index.js) 🛗

Create a new file called `index.js` and add this code:

```javascript
import express from "express"

const app = express()

app.get("/api", (req, res) => {
  return res.status(200).json({
    message: "server working",
  })
})

app.listen(5000, () => console.log("Server is running on 5000"))
```

### Step 6: Hire a Building Manager (Install PM2) 👷

PM2 will keep our building running 24/7:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

### Step 7: Open for Business! 🎉

Start your new skyscraper:

```bash
pm2 start "npm run dev"
```

## Part 2: Setting Up Your Traffic Control Tower (Nginx Reverse Proxy) 🗼

### Step 1: Configure Your Control Tower 🔧

Open your Nginx config file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

### Step 2: Program Your Traffic Controller 🚦

Replace the content with this:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Test and Launch Your Control Tower 🚀

Check if everything's okay:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If it says "OK", let's start directing traffic:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## You Did It! Your Web Skyscraper is Open for Business! 🎊

Congratulations, web architect! You've just built a high-tech API skyscraper with its own traffic control tower. Now when someone visits `http://<your-server-ip>/api`, they'll get a warm welcome message:

```json
{ "message": "server working" }
```

Your Express app is now running behind Nginx, protected and ready to handle tons of visitors. Keep building and reaching for the (web) stars! 🌟🏙️
